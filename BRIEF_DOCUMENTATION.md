# Classes

---

## Counter.java

*implements Serializable*<br><br>
Its instances represent the actual counters.
See [Counter.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/CreateCounterActivity.java),
[Serializable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html).

### Public constructors

This class has no public constructors, use `Counter#create()` instead.

### public int getDaysRemaining()

Returns the number of the days left by substracting current date from the target one. If you want to create a display string, it is advised to use `Util.getDaysRemaining()` instead.
### public static void refresh()
Refreshes the [Calendar](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) instance, for the calendar is static
and when midnight passes, it still uses data for the old day.
### public static Counter create(String id, String name, int targetDay, int targetMonth, int targetYear, int targetAge)
Used to create instances instead of constructors.
### public String getDateString()
Stringifies the data of the Counter in a predefined format DD/MM/YYYY (age).
### public static void addEventListener(CounterEventListener listener)
Registers a listener for counter events.
### public static List<CounterEventListener> getEventListeners()
Returns the counter event listeners list.

---

## CounterManager.java

Manages the counter collection.
### Public constructors
This is a singleton class, use `CounterManager#getInstance()` to access the instance.
### public boolean addCounter(String name, int targetDay, int targetMonth, int targetYear, int targetAge)
Adds a counter to the collection. Returns true on success, false on fail (arguments).
### public void deleteCounter(String id)
Removes counter from the collection.
### public void save()
Saves the counters into internal storage using JSON.
### public void load()
Loads the counters from internal storage using JSON.
### public static CounterManager getInstance()
Returns the manager instance.
### public Counter getCounterOfId(String id)
Returns the counter of the corresponding id or null.
### public ArrayList<Counter> getNotificationCounters()
Returns a list of counters with positive notification status.
### public ArrayList<Counter> getWidgetCounters()
Returns a list of counters that are bound to a widget.
### public ArrayList<Counter> getCounters()

## FileUtil.java, SketchwareUtil.java
Sketchware's util classes. I wanted to alter `FileUtil` to implement some custom methods, but the changes were never persistent, so I could not use them.
These files are pregenerated by Sketchware itself and are used within Sketchware-generated code and some of my code, too. See
[FileUtil.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/FileUtil.java),
[SketchwareUtil.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/SketchwareUtil.java).

---

## SketchApplication.java
*extends Application*<br><br>
The Application subclass, pregenerated by Sketchware. See [Application]().

---

## NotificationService.java
*extends Service implements DateChangedListener, CounterEventListener, LocaleChangedListener*<br><br>
Creates and runs the notifications.
See [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java),
[Service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service),
[DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java),
[LocaleChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/LocaleChangedListener.java),
[CounterEventListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/CounterEventListener.java).
### public static void createNotificationChannel()
Notification channel is what the notifications are registered under in the app's system settings page. Since Android {idk the exact version}, the user has the ability to choose
which notifications to allow and which to block. The notification won't appear if it is not bound to a `NotificationChannel`.
See [Create and Manage Notification Channels](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels),
[NotificationChannel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel)
### public void registerReceiver()
Registers [ServiceLauncher.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/ServiceLauncher)
as a [BroadcastReceiver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver),
making it hear the broadcasts. Since the `NotificationService` is running all the time, so will the receiver. See
[Broadcast overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts).
### public void registerListener()
Adds `NotificationService` on the list of `DateChangedListener` implementors, happenning it to be notified when the date changes.
See [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java).
### createNotifications()
Creates the notifications for the counters.
### public void ropeIsTheWayPleaseHelpMe()
This method does what a `removeNotification()` method would do. It removes a notification. The problem is that one notification has to alwaysbe around, because such are the rules for [foreground services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services). Thus we need to check this scenario and eventually recreate some other notification as the service indicator. 

---

## ServiceLauncher.java
*extends BroadcastReceiver*<br><br>
Listens for broadcasts and upon interception notifies all the [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java) implementors
to refresh their stuff. It also starts the [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java)
upon boot. See [ServiceLauncher.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/ServiceLauncher.java),
[BroadcastReceiver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver).
### public static void addDateChangedListener(DateChangedListener listener) 
### public static void addLocaleChangedListener(LocaleChangedListener listener)

---

## Util.java
A collection of handy methods to simplify tasks in other modules. See  [Util.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/Util.java).
### public static void setContextIfNull(Context context)
Sets the default context for contextless methods. Tries to avoid memory leaks as much as possible. See [Context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context).
### public static Context getContext()
Returns the stored context (can be null).
### public static void startService()
Starts the  [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java).
### public static String getDaysRemaining(Counter counter, Context context)
Creates a translated output string for the counter.
###  public static void refreshWidgets(Context context)
Refreshes all the widgets
### public static void stopService(Context context)
Stops the notification service. (Shuts all notifications).

## Widget(Light)Activity.java
*extends Activity*<br><br>
The widget setup activity. See  [WidgetActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/WidgetActivity.java),
