# Classes
## Counter.java
*implements Serializable*<br><br>
Its instances represent the actual counters. Other app components can use the `Counter#getDaysRemaining()` method to get the count, however it is advised to use Util#getDaysremaining() for translation matters. 
See [Counter.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/CreateCounterActivity.java), 
[Util.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/Util.java),
[Serializable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html).
### public int getDaysRemaining()
Returns the number of the days left by substracting current date from the target one.
### public static void refresh()
Refreshes the [Calendar](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) instance, for the calendar is static
and when midnight passes, it still uses data for the old day.
### public static Counter create()
Used to create instances instead of constructors.
## CounterManager.java
Manages the counter collection.
### public boolean addCounter()
Adds a counter to the collection. Returns true on success, false on fail (arguments).
### public void deleteCounter()
Removes counter from the collection.
### public void save()
Saves the counters into internal storage using serialization.
### public void load()
Loads the counters from internal storage using serialization.
### public static CounterManager getInstance()
Returns the manager (singleton).
### public Counter getCounterOfId()
Returns the counter of the corresponding id or null.
### public ArrayList<Counter> getNotificationCounters()
Returns a list of counters with positive notification status.
### public ArrayList<Counter> getWidgetCounters()
Returns a list of counters that are bound to a widget.
## MainActivity.java, CreateCounterActivity.java, SettingsActivity.java
*extends AppCompatActivity*<br><br>
Android activities running the screens we see when using the app. See 
[MainActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/MainActivity.java), 
[CreateCounterActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/CreateCounterActivity.java), 
[SettingsActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/SettingsActivity.java),

[Introduction to activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities)
## FileUtil.java, SketchwareUtil.java
Sketchware's util classes. I wanted to alter `FileUtil` to implement some custom methods, but the changes were never persistent, so I could not use them.
These files are pregenerated by Sketchware itself and are used within Sketchware-generated code and some of my code, too. See
[FileUtil.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/FileUtil.java), 
[SketchwareUtil.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/SketchwareUtil.java).
## SketchApplication.java
*extends Application*<br><br>
The Application subclass, pregenerated by Sketchware. See [Application]().
## NotificationService.java
*extends Service implements DateChangedListener, CounterEventListener*<br><br>
Creates and runs the notifications. 
See [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java),
[Service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service),
[DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java),
[CounterEventListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/CounterEventListener.java). 
### public static void createNotificationChannel()
Notification channel is what the notifications are registered under in the app's system settings page. Since Android {idk the exact version}, the user has the ability to choose
which notifications to allow and which to block. The notification won't appear if it is not bound to a `NotificationChannel`.
See [Create and Manage Notification Channels](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels),
[NotificationChannel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel)
### public void registerReceiver()
Registers [ServiceLauncher.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/ServiceLauncher) 
 as a [BroadcastReceiver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver),
making it hear the broadcasts. Since the `NotificationService` is running all the time, so will the receiver. See
[Broadcast overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts).
### public void registerListener()
Adds `NotificationService` on the list of `DateChangedListener` implementors, happenning it to be notified when the date changes.
See [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java).
### createNotifications()
Creates the notifications for the counters.
## ServiceLauncher.java
*extends BroadcastReceiver*<br><br>
Listens for broadcasts and upon interception notifies all the [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java) implementors
to refresh their stuff. It also starts the [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java) 
upon boot. See [ServiceLauncher.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/ServiceLauncher.java),
[BroadcastReceiver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver).
## Util.java
A collection of handy methods to simplify tasks in other modules. See  [Util.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/Util.java). 
### public void setContext(Context context)
Sets the default context for contextless methods. See [Context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context).
### public static void startService()
Starts the  [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java). 
## Widget(Light)Activity.java
*extends Activity*<br><br>
The widget setup activity. See  [WidgetActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/WidgetActivity.java),

[App widgets overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/overview),
[Create a simple widget](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets),
[Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity).
## Widget(Light)Provider.java
*extends AppWidgetProvider*<br><br>
The backend behind our app's widget. Handles the logic, the content, etc. See [WidgetProvider.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/WidgetProvider.java),
[WidgetLightProvider.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/WidgetLightProvider.java),
[AppWidgetProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProvider).
### void updateWidget(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int appWidgetId)
Updates the content of the widget, making sure the remaining days count is up to date
# Interfaces
## CounterEventListener.java
An interface to provide a communication channel between components, that need to update when there are changes to the counters.

### Implemented by:
- [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java)
### public void onCounterDeleted(Counter counter)
Notifies the implementors that a counter has been deleted and provides access the the former counter's data.
### public void onCounterNotificationStateChanged(Counter counter)
Notifies the implementors that a counter's notification state has changed and provides access to the counter's data.
## DateChangedListener.java
An interface to provide a communication channel between components, that need to update when the date of the world changes.
See [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java) 
### Implemented by: 
- [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java)
### public void onDateChanged(Counter counter)
