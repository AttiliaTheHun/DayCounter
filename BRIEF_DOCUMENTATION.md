Note: If you are not familiar with Android app developement, I suggest googling "how do Android apps work" or browsing [this](https://developer.android.com/guide).
# Classes
## Counter.java
Counts the days remaining. Other app components use the `Counter#getDaysRemaining()` method to get the count. See [Counter.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/CreateCounterActivity.java)
### public static int getDaysRemaining()
Returns the number of the days left by substracting current date from the target one
### public static void refresh()
Refreshes the [Calendar](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) instance, for the calendar is static
and when midnight passes, it still uses data for the old day
## MainActivity.java, CreateCounterActivity.java, SettingsActivity.java
Android activities running the screens we see when using the app. See 
[MainActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/MainActivity.java), 
[CreateCounterActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/CreateCounterActivity.java), 
[SettingsActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/SettingsActivity.java),
[Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity),
[Introduction to activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities)
## DateChangedListener.java
An interface to provide a communication channel between components, that need to update when the date of the world changes.
See [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java) 
### Implemented by:
- [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/MainActivity.java) 
- [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java)
### public void onDateChanged()
The method to be implemented by the implementors and called when necessary (when date changes)
## FileUtil.java, SketchwareUtil.java
Sketchware's util classes. I wanted to alter `FileUtil` to implement some custom methods, but the changes were never persistent, so I could not use them.
These files are pregenerated by Sketchware itself and are used within Sketchware-generated code and some of my code, too. See
[FileUtil.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/FileUtil.java), 
[SketchwareUtil.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/SketchwareUtil.java)
## NotificationService.java
Creates and runs the notification. See [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java) 
### public static void createNotificationChannel()
Notification channel is what the notification is registered as in the app's system settings page. Since Android {idk the exact version}, the user has the ability to choose
which notifications to allow and which to block. The notification won't appear if it is not bound to a `NotificationChannel`.
See [Create and Manage Notification Channels](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels),
[NotificationChannel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel)
### public void registerReceiver()
Registers [ServiceLauncher.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/ServiceLauncher) 
 as a [BroadcastReceiver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver),
making it hear the broadcasts. Since the `NotificationService` is running all the time, so will the receiver. See
[Broadcast overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts)
### public void registerListener()
Adds `NotificationService` on the list of `DateChangedListener` implementors, happenning it to be notified when the date changes.
See [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java) 
## ServiceLauncher.java
Listens for broadcasts and upon interception notifies all the [DateChangedListener.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/DateChangedListener.java) implementors
to refresh their stuff. It also starts the [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java) 
upon boot. See [ServiceLauncher.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/ServiceLauncher.java) 
## Util.java
A collection of handy methods to simplify tasks in other modules. See  [Util.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/Util.java) 
### public void setContext(Context context)
Sets the default context for contextless methods. See [Context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context)
### public static void startService()
Starts the  [NotificationService.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/NotificationService.java) 
## WidgetActivity.java
Manages the view of the homescreen widget. See  [WidgetActivity.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/WidgetActivity.java),
[App widgets overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/overview),
[Create a simple widget](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets)
## WidgetProvider.java
The backend behind our app's widget. Handles the logic, the content, etc. See [WidgetProvider.java](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/app/src/main/java/attilathehun/daycounter/WidgetProvider.java),
[AppWidgetProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProvider)
### void updateWidget(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int appWidgetId)
Updates the content of the widget, making sure the remaining days count is up to date
