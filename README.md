# DayCounter
A simple Android app counting remaining days until a given date
## Features
- Notification service displaying the amount of remaining days
- Homescreen widget displaying the amount of remaining days
- Starts on boot
### Notes
- The app has no settings, you can not stop it from displaying the notif within the app, use the system notification manager
- The app is tested to work on Android 10 when the user uses the app as intended, there may be bugs and undesired features which I will appreacite in Issues
- The UI sucks
## Items For Mental Consultation
- Yes, I made the app in [Sketchware Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro) (on PHONE)
- I am quite concerned that the following classes are completely useless and contribute nothing to the app, yet I am too lazy to verify this statement and eventually remove the class: BluetoothConnect, BluetoothController, RequestNetwork, RequestNetworkController
## How to build
Seriously, I have no idea
## Credits
I stole the icon from [Icons8](https://icons8.com)
