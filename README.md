This is the original version (1.1), the initial, the only one that was meant to be. However, I have been forced to create a new, multi-counter version which is now the major one for it fixes bugs and provides functionality. The new readme is [here](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/README.md).<br>
# DayCounter
A simple Android app counting remaining days until a given date. It was origianlly meant to give you a precise idea of how many days you have left until you reach a certain age (eg. 60 years), but you can use it for any sort of day counting.<br>
<br>
I have been told that the code is a mess and it is hard to understand how does it work (the fact that I already forgot underlines that I guess), so I decided to make a small docs [here](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/blob/master/BRIEF_DOCUMENTATION.md).
## Features
- Notification service displaying the amount of remaining days
- Homescreen widget displaying the amount of remaining days
- Starts on boot
### Notes
- The app is tested to work on Android 10 when the user uses the app as intended, there may be bugs and undesired features which I will appreacite in Issues (and won't ever fix)
- The UI sucks
## Items For Mental Consultation
- Yes, I made the app in [Sketchware Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro) (on PHONE)
## How to build
Seriously, I have no idea
### Build in Sketchware
See [Releases](https://github.com/AttiliaTheHun/DayCounter/releases) and pick the file with `.swb` extension. It is a Sketchware backup file and you can use it to import this application as a Sketchware project. **Be sure to use __Sketchware Pro__ as I used several features the original Sketchware app does not offer.**
## Credits
I stole the icon from [Icons8](https://icons8.com)
### Examples
#### Example 1: How many days until I reach 60?
When the app asks you for your birth date, be sure to enter the birth date and in the age box type '60'.

#### Example 2: How many days until it is 2 years from now?
Into the birth date form you enter today's date and into the age box you type '2'.
